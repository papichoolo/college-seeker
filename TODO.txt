1. Backend Side (DB, Business Logic and API Architechture):
- Vector Index has too much RAW/Unstructured Data 
What to do? Convert this into a semi-structured database with actual schema. 

VECTOR DB -> NOSQL (MONOGO) DATABASE (COLLECTION NAME: COURSES)
TOPICS SURROUNDING THE SOLUTION
FULL-TEXT SEARCH, HYBRID-SEARCH

- Adding Website/Portfolio/Social Media Integration for Student Information.
WHAT TO DO?
Look into better Webscraping/Browser Automation Pipeline 
 Selenium


 - Improve Similarity Search by Allowing Metadata Filtering.
 WHAT TO DO?
 Improve existing VECTORDB Schema by adding metadata about source/relatedStudent Info.
 To fetch the relevant docs perform a simple query instead of Vector Similarity Search.


 2. FRONT-END/LLM Presentation Changes
 - Issue: Recommendations do not show up in a list manner.
    - Why: (COLLECTION NAME: COURSES) IS NOT IMPLEMENTED. This means that we dont have a database of courses. We only RAW UNSTRUCTED DATA.
    - WHAT TO DO? FIGURE OUT THE BACKEND PROBLEM 1 and then allow a Re-ranker list of courses appropriate for the student. 
    This re-ranking algorithm will take in Student metadata, Student profile and will be using technique like, Hybrid Search.

 - Citations/Sources of LLM output
 WHAT TO DO: PROMPT THE LLM IN OUTPUT TO PROVIDE Sources. 
 You could do this programatically or just allow the LLM to point out Citations. 


 3. Fullstack Change 
 Allow the creation of User Accounts/Profiles
 Store Persistent User Information Like Profiles/Resumes/ Recommendation
